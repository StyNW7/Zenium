- [x] Examine backend recommendation controller for dummy data/fallback logic
- [x] Review journal controller analysis endpoint for dummy responses
- [x] Check AI workflow service for hardcoded recommendations
- [x] Analyze recommendation model structure
- [x] Identify all fallback/dummy generation points

COMPLETED REMOVAL OF ALL DUMMY/FALLBACK LOGIC:
✅ Journal controller analyzeJournal(): Removed hardcoded AI fallback data
✅ Journal controller getGuidedQuestions(): Removed hardcoded fallback questions
✅ AI workflow service: Removed all fallback generators and unused methods
✅ Recommendation controller generateAIRecommendationSuggestions(): Removed hardcoded suggestion fallback
✅ Updated all error handling to fail without dummy responses
✅ Cleaned up unused fallback methods

SYSTEM NOW USES ONLY REAL AI GENERATION:
- All journal analysis now requires AI service to work
- All recommendation generation is AI-powered only
- No fallback dummy responses anywhere in the system
- Error handling properly fails rather than returning dummy data

- [x] Remove journal controller hardcoded AI fallback data
- [x] Remove journal controller hardcoded guided questions fallback
- [x] Remove AI workflow service fallback generators
- [x] Remove recommendation controller hardcoded fallback
- [x] Ensure real AI generation for all cases
- [x] Update error handling to not return dummy data
- [x] Test recommendation system integration
- [x] Verify recommendations are always AI-generated
